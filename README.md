Hi. I'm ≈Åukasz, a self-taught web developer writing in JavaScript. I gather experience and practical knowledge by creating my own small-scale commercial projects. So far I have worked in MERN stack (**M**ongoDB **E**xpress.js **R**eact.js **N**ode.js).

I am proud to present my first full-stack project - a single page application with appointmnent scheduler that serves as a website for a psychologist. Take a look into the pinned repositories [ec-api](https://github.com/l-walaszczyk/ec-api) and [ec-ui](https://github.com/l-walaszczyk/ec-ui) to see more. Please note that I continuously improve the projects as I learn more and any comments to my work are welcome - be it the code or user experience.

For a sample of my current front-end skills, please visit my [portfolio](https://l-walaszczyk.github.io/portfolio).

While working on my next project (admin panel for the appointment scheduler) I'm going to learn TDD, react-bootstrap and Redux. After that, my next goal will probably be to learn TypeScript.
