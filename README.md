Hi. I'm ≈Åukasz, a self-taught fullstack web developer writing in JavaScript. I gather experience and practical knowledge by creating my own small-scale commercial projects. So far I have worked in MERN stack (**M**ongoDB **E**xpress.js **R**eact.js **N**ode.js).

I am proud to present my first full-stack project - a single page application with appointmnent scheduler that serves as a website for a psychologist. Take a look into the pinned repositories [ec-api](https://github.com/l-walaszczyk/ec-api) and [ec-ui](https://github.com/l-walaszczyk/ec-ui) to see more. Please note that I continuously improve the code as I learn more and any comments to my work are welcome.

I'm eager to learn new technologies, especially I want to get a grasp on Angular framework and TypeScript while working on an upcoming project (admin panel for the appointment scheduler).
